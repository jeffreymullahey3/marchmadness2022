Modeling is done in the "logistic_regression" file within the mens-march-mania-2022 folder.

Data for the competition is provided by kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mens-march-mania-2022/data

I downloaded the data onto my local computer and pointed my python code to it locally. You would have to change the folder names if you wanted to run this code.

I originally did this competition using SAS to do all the data cleaning/prep, and then built and XGBoost classification model in python. I lost all of that code though so this repository is a redo of the whole thing.
